## More info

Renderlet is building a WebAssembly framework for writing graphics code that runs anywhere.
Developers can use renderlet to embed GPU-accelerated 2D and 3D graphics into cross-platform applications.

This includes:
* A compiler that takes a high-level specification of your graphics pipeline, any assets, custom functions, and libraries, and builds self-contained WebAssembly modules
* A rendering engine, wander, that embeds into any application, on any platform, that safely runs the renderlet modules with the platformâ€™s GPU
* A visual editor that makes it easy to compile graphics and visualization pipelines out of reusable modules

Anybody should be able to build interactive applications without having to be a graphics programming expert.  

## Example
A sample configuration / model is provided for the compiler from the talk is available in [demo.yml](demo.yml). The playground is currently in preview - please contact us for more info.
